## Hi there 👋

- Hi, I'm Tristan Ta
- I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering
- I chose my major because my uncles and aunts were Electrical Engineers.

- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I hope to learn and become efficient in writing code in C
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  A movie that I would recommend would be "Everything Everywhere All at Once
